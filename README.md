![Alt text](/assets/images/hero.png)

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

Make sure you've developped the corresponding ESP32 code. If not, then check out [mine](https://github.com/e-idrissa/iot-mqtt-app-1).

Open your ESP32 code with [Platform.io](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/vscode.html) and upload it to your board.

Then, install `node-red`.
```bash
npm install node-red
```

Afterward, run it
```bash
node-red
```

Everything is set. Congratulations ðŸŽ‰
